KNN Classifier and Regressor
# ðŸ§  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification & Regression

This repository demonstrates the implementation of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for both **classification** and **regression** tasks using Python.  
KNN is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm that works based on feature similarity â€” predicting the output based on the *k* nearest data points in the feature space.
